Introduction to Cloud Computing


Cloud computing is a transformative technology that delivers computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
 and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning physical hardware or maintaining on-premise data centers,
 businesses and individuals can access computing resources on demand from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

One of the key advantages of cloud computing is its scalability. 
Organizations can easily scale up or down based on demand, paying only for the resources they use.
 This flexibility reduces costs, improves efficiency, and accelerates innovation. Additionally, cloud computing enables remote access,
  allowing users to work from anywhere with an internet connection.

Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., virtual machines, storage).

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Offers a development environment for building, testing, and deploying applications without managing infrastructure.

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)– Delivers ready-to-use software applications via the cloud (e.g., Gmail, Microsoft 365).

Deployment models include public cloud(shared resources), **private cloud** (dedicated infrastructure), and **hybrid cloud** (a mix of both).

Cloud computing enhances security, disaster recovery, and collaboration while reducing operational burdens. As businesses increasingly adopt digital transformation strategies,
 cloud technology continues to evolve, integrating artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and edge computing for even greater efficiency and innovation.

In summary, cloud computing revolutionizes how businesses operate by offering cost-effective, scalable, and secure solutions that drive productivity and growth.
