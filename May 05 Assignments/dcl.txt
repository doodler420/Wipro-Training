What is DCL?
DCL (Data Control Language) is a subset of SQL used to manage database security by controlling user access permissions.

Key Features
✔ User Management: Create, modify, or delete users.
✔ Permission Control: Grant or revoke access to database objects (tables, views, procedures).
✔ Security Enforcement: Ensures only authorized users can perform specific operations.
